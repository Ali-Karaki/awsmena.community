    An intro to AWS account security and and how we are moving our team at The
    LEGO Group towards security best practices by giving them one less thing to
    worry about and taking away their personal AWS keys (and making the process
    of acquiring temporary AWS keys as easy as running a command).

    Everything fails, all the time. This is what Dr. Vogels likes to say. This
    is what we have learned over and over again while implementing serverless
    data streaming at scale. I’ll take the example of my customer, Yle, and talk
    about the services we used, issues we faced and lessons we learned.
