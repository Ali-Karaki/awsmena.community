    The AWS Community Day is a free full day event for AWS users organized by
    the community. Once a year all AWS users come together to network, learn
    from each other and get inspired. At this event, there will be no vendor
    talks, no partner talks, no sponsored talks. All speakers are expert AWS
    users from the community - including AWS User Group leaders and AWS Heroes -
    with real life experience in the AWS topics they are presenting.
